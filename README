This uses public subtitles data and allows you to find subtitles by BBC 
PID plus number of seconds in. It uses Chanelography urls to find the 
iPlayer ones or if that fails (which is sometimes does for new 
programmes), looks to iPlayer directly. We can't use the Channelography 
ones as they've no timestamps.

It now does a lookup for entities on Lupedia and using a regex and 
dbpedia for comparison.
